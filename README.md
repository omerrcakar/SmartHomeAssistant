# SmartHomeAssistant

Smart home assistant mobile application that I made as part of my IoT university course. I can change the light, door and temperature values ​​in the MongoDB database from my application. I used SwiftUI technology and Alamofire for network requests. I used MVVM architecture. I changed the values ​​with PUT requests.
